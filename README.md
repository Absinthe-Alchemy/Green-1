# Green-1 soon to be completed ;)

This is classic green absinthe recipe by AA was originally created in April 2015.
  All ingredients calculations for 50l l'ambic 
  Better alcogol is better absinthe, use best you have.
  Herbs must be dry and fresh, crushed, but not grinded, powder is bad.
  
  Main algorithm: 

1. Mazeration 
  

2. Distillation


3. Colouration 

4. Wait as long as you can. 
    Alternatively you can do the same process as mazeration but with final product to "time-mashine" it and make taste rise up confidently.
